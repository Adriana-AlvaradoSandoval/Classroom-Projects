Welcome to Snakes and Ladders!

In this game, you embody a brave turtle, embarking on a thrilling journey across a board filled with surprises.

Your Mission: Navigate this unpredictable realm with strategy and luck, aiming to land precisely in Space 99. 
Your progress is determined by the roll of a dice, dictating how many spaces you'll move forward.

Beware! Your path is not without its challenges:

Red Snakes: These sneaky serpents lurk in certain spaces, ready to send you sliding back down the board. 
Stepping on the head of a snake will cost you precious space, potentially derailing your lead.

Green Ladders: Your hope and salvation! Climb up a ladder to swiftly ascend the board, bypassing obstacles, 
and getting closer to your goal. Landing on the base of a ladder will give you a significant boost forward.

A Twist of Fate: Reaching the end of the board requires precision. Roll too high on your final dice throw, 
and you'll overshoot Space 99, sending you spiraling back to the start as a consequence of your overzealous 
advance.

Your mission is a delicate balance of risk and reward, where every roll can change your fate.

Good luck!
